"""Prompt templates for the people research agent.

This module contains all the prompt templates used by the research agent,
including prompts for query generation, information extraction, and reflection analysis.
"""

QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research analyst tasked with evaluating the completeness and quality of research notes about a person. Your goal is to determine if the gathered information is sufficient or if additional research is needed.

Here is the person being researched: {person}

Here are the research notes collected so far:
<research_notes>
{completed_notes}
</research_notes>

Here is the information schema we need to populate:
<extraction_schema>
{extraction_schema}
</extraction_schema>

Your task is to:

1. **EXTRACT STRUCTURED INFORMATION**: Analyze the research notes and extract any available information that matches the schema fields. Convert unstructured notes into structured data.

2. **ASSESS COMPLETENESS**: Evaluate how well the current research covers each required field in the schema:
   - Years of experience
   - Current company
   - Current role  
   - Prior companies (with roles and duration)

3. **IDENTIFY GAPS**: Determine what critical information is missing or unclear.

4. **MAKE RESEARCH DECISION**: Decide whether to:
   - CONTINUE: Additional research is needed because critical information is missing
   - CONCLUDE: Sufficient information has been gathered to meet the requirements

5. **PROVIDE REASONING**: Explain your decision with specific details about what information is present, missing, or needs clarification.

Please respond with a structured analysis that includes:
- extracted_info: Dictionary containing the structured information found
- completeness_assessment: Analysis of how complete each schema field is (0-100%)
- missing_information: List of specific information gaps
- research_decision: Either "CONTINUE" or "CONCLUDE"
- reasoning: Detailed explanation of your decision
- suggested_queries: If continuing, suggest 2-3 specific search queries to fill the gaps

Focus on the core professional information: work experience, current position, and career history. Be thorough but practical in your assessment."""
