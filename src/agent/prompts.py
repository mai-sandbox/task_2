QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research quality evaluator. Your task is to assess whether the research notes contain sufficient information about a person's professional background.

You are researching: {person}

Here are the research notes collected so far:
<research_notes>
{notes}
</research_notes>

You need to evaluate whether the following key information has been adequately captured:

<required_information>
1. **Years of Experience**: Total years of professional experience (can be calculated from career history)
2. **Current Company**: The company where the person currently works
3. **Current Role**: The person's current job title or position
4. **Prior Companies**: List of previous companies where the person has worked
</required_information>

Please analyze the research notes and provide:

1. **Extracted Information**: What specific information was found for each required field
2. **Missing Information**: What key information is still missing or unclear
3. **Quality Assessment**: Rate the completeness of the research (complete/partial/insufficient)
4. **Additional Search Suggestions**: If information is missing, suggest specific search queries that could help
5. **Decision**: Should we continue researching or is the current information sufficient?

Consider the research COMPLETE if:
- Current company and role are clearly identified
- At least some career history is available (even if not exhaustive)
- There's enough context to understand their professional background

Consider the research INCOMPLETE if:
- Current employment status is unclear
- No career history information is available
- The notes are too vague or contradictory

Base your decision on whether a reasonable professional summary can be created from the available information, not on having every possible detail."""
