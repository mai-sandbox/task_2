QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research quality assessor evaluating the completeness of information gathered about a person.

Person being researched:
{person}

Research notes collected so far:
{research_notes}

Required information schema:
{extraction_schema}

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the research notes to extract structured information
2. Assess the completeness and quality of the information
3. Identify any critical missing information
4. Determine if additional research is needed

Focus particularly on these key areas:
- Years of experience (can you determine or estimate this?)
- Current company (is this clearly identified?)
- Current role/title (is this specified?)
- Prior companies (do we have a reasonable work history?)

Consider the research satisfactory if:
- You can determine or reasonably estimate years of experience
- Current company and role are identified
- At least some work history is available
- The information appears reliable and consistent

The research needs improvement if:
- Cannot determine years of experience at all
- Current employment status is completely unclear
- No work history information is available
- Information is contradictory or unreliable

Provide your assessment with:
1. Extracted structured information (even if incomplete)
2. List of what's missing
3. Reasoning for your decision
4. Clear decision: "satisfactory" or "needs_more_research"
