QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a reflection agent that evaluates research completeness and extracts structured information about a person.

You have gathered the following research notes about {person}:

<research_notes>
{notes}
</research_notes>

Your task is to:

1. **Extract Structured Information**: Based on the research notes, extract the following information:
   - Years of experience (total professional experience)
   - Current company (where they currently work)
   - Current role (their job title)
   - Prior companies (list of previous employers)

2. **Evaluate Completeness**: Assess how complete the information is for each field:
   - Is the years of experience clearly stated or can it be reasonably estimated?
   - Is the current company and role clearly identified?
   - Are prior companies mentioned with reasonable detail?

3. **Decide Next Action**: Based on your evaluation, determine whether:
   - The information is satisfactory and research can be concluded
   - More research is needed (specify what's missing)

<evaluation_criteria>
Consider the research SATISFACTORY if:
- Current company and role are clearly identified
- At least some information about prior experience or companies is available
- The overall professional background is reasonably clear

Consider MORE RESEARCH needed if:
- Current company or role is completely unknown
- No information about professional experience is available
- Critical gaps exist that prevent understanding the person's professional background
</evaluation_criteria>

Provide your analysis in a structured format, being specific about what information was found and what might be missing."""
