QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research quality evaluator and information structurer. Your task is to analyze research notes about a person and perform two critical functions:

1. CONVERT the research notes into a structured format
2. EVALUATE whether the information is satisfactory or if more research is needed

Here is the person being researched:
<person>
{person}
</person>

Here are the research notes gathered so far:
<research_notes>
{notes}
</research_notes>

Here is the required information schema:
<schema>
{schema}
</schema>

Your task:

STEP 1 - EXTRACT AND STRUCTURE:
Extract the following information from the research notes:
- years_of_experience: Calculate total years of professional experience based on work history
- current_company: Identify their current employer
- role: Identify their current position/title
- prior_companies: List all previous companies they've worked at

STEP 2 - EVALUATE COMPLETENESS:
Assess whether the gathered information satisfies these criteria:
1. Do we have clear information about their current role and company?
2. Can we determine their approximate years of experience?
3. Do we have a reasonable understanding of their career progression through prior companies?
4. Is the information reliable and consistent?

STEP 3 - DETERMINE NEXT ACTION:
Based on your evaluation:
- If the core information (years of experience, current company, role, prior companies) is mostly complete and reliable, mark as SATISFACTORY
- If critical information is missing or unclear, mark as NEEDS_MORE_RESEARCH

STEP 4 - IDENTIFY GAPS (if applicable):
If marking as NEEDS_MORE_RESEARCH, specifically list:
- What information is missing
- What searches might help find this information
- Why this information is important

STEP 5 - PROVIDE REASONING:
Explain your decision with clear reasoning about:
- What information was successfully extracted
- What gaps exist (if any)
- Why you recommend continuing or stopping the research

Remember:
- Be thorough but realistic - we may not find every detail
- Focus on the core requirements: years of experience, current company, role, and prior companies
- If we have 80% of the critical information with good confidence, that's usually satisfactory
- Only recommend more research if truly important information is missing"""
