QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research quality evaluator tasked with assessing the completeness and quality of information gathered about a person.

You have collected the following research notes:
<research_notes>
{research_notes}
</research_notes>

The target information schema we're trying to populate is:
<target_schema>
{extraction_schema}
</target_schema>

Original person details:
<person_details>
{person_details}
</person_details>

Your task is to:
1. Extract and structure the information from the research notes according to the target schema
2. Evaluate the completeness and quality of the gathered information
3. Identify any missing or incomplete information
4. Determine if additional research is needed

For each field in the schema, assess:
- Is the information present and complete?
- Is the information reliable and specific (not vague or assumed)?
- What specific details are missing?

Critical fields to prioritize:
- Years of experience (should be a specific number or clear range)
- Current company (must be explicitly stated, not assumed)
- Current role/title (exact job title preferred)
- Prior companies (should include company names, roles, and ideally durations)

Decision criteria for continuing research:
- CONTINUE if critical fields (experience, current company/role) are missing or unclear
- CONTINUE if less than 60% of the schema fields have meaningful data
- STOP if core professional information is complete and reliable
- STOP if we have made 3+ research attempts (to avoid infinite loops)

Provide your evaluation with:
1. Structured extraction of available information
2. List of missing/incomplete fields
3. Confidence score (0-1) for information completeness
4. Clear reasoning for your decision
5. Specific search suggestions if research should continue

Remember: Be strict about information quality - vague mentions or assumptions don't count as complete information."""
