"""Prompt templates for the people research agent workflow.

and reflection analysis prompts.
"""

QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research analyst tasked with analyzing research notes about a person and extracting structured information.

Here are the research notes from web searches:
<research_notes>
{completed_notes}
</research_notes>

Here is the person being researched:
<person_info>
{person}
</person_info>

Your task is to analyze these notes and extract the following structured information:

<extraction_schema>
{extraction_schema}
</extraction_schema>

Please provide your analysis in the following format:

## EXTRACTED INFORMATION

**Years of Experience:** [Extract total years of professional work experience, or "Unknown" if not found]

**Current Company:** [Extract current employer/company name, or "Unknown" if not found]

**Current Role:** [Extract current job title/position, or "Unknown" if not found]

## ANALYSIS

**Information Completeness:** [Rate from 1-10 how complete the information is]

**Missing Information:** [List specific information that is missing or unclear]

**Research Quality:** [Assess if the current research provides sufficient detail]

## DECISION

**Needs More Research:** [YES/NO - whether additional research is needed]

**Reasoning:** [Explain your decision - why more research is or isn't needed]

**Suggested Next Steps:** [If more research is needed, suggest what specific information to search for]

Guidelines:
1. Be precise and factual - only extract information that is clearly stated in the notes
2. If information is ambiguous or unclear, mark it as "Unclear" and suggest more research
3. Consider the completeness and reliability of the information found
4. Recommend more research if key information is missing or if there are inconsistencies
5. Focus on professional work experience, current employment, and career history"""
