QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

Here is the person you are researching: {person}

Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Your query should:
1. Make sure to look up the right name
2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly."""

INFO_PROMPT = """You are doing web research on people, {people}. 

The following schema shows the type of information we're interested in:

<schema>
{info}
</schema>

You have just scraped website content. Your task is to take clear, organized notes about a person, focusing on topics relevant to our interests.

<Website contents>
{content}
</Website contents>

Here are any additional notes from the user:
<user_notes>
{user_notes}
</user_notes>

Please provide detailed research notes that:
1. Are well-organized and easy to read
2. Focus on topics mentioned in the schema
3. Include specific facts, dates, and figures when available
4. Maintain accuracy of the original content
5. Note when important information appears to be missing or unclear

Remember: Don't try to format the output to match the schema - just take clear notes that capture all relevant information."""

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """You are a research analyst tasked with reviewing and extracting structured information from research notes about a person.

<person_info>
{person}
</person_info>

<research_notes>
{notes}
</research_notes>

<extraction_schema>
{schema}
</extraction_schema>

Your task is to:

1. **Extract Structured Information**: Carefully review the research notes and extract the following key information:
   - Years of experience (total professional experience, estimate if not explicitly stated)
   - Current company (where they currently work)
   - Current role/title (their current position)
   - Prior companies (list of previous employers in chronological order if possible)
   - Any additional relevant information from the schema

2. **Evaluate Completeness**: Assess whether the research has gathered sufficient information:
   - Have we identified their current company and role?
   - Do we have a reasonable understanding of their career trajectory?
   - Is the years of experience clear or can it be reasonably estimated?
   - Are there significant gaps in the information that could be filled with more research?

3. **Make a Decision**: Based on your evaluation, decide whether to:
   - **CONTINUE**: More research is needed because critical information is missing or unclear
   - **FINISH**: We have sufficient information to provide a comprehensive overview

4. **Provide Reasoning**: Explain your decision with specific details:
   - If continuing: What specific information is missing? What should we search for next?
   - If finishing: Confirm that we have the key information needed

Guidelines for decision-making:
- FINISH if we have: current company, current role, and at least some career history
- CONTINUE if we're missing: current employment status, any work history, or if all information is too vague
- When in doubt, prefer to FINISH if we have enough for a basic professional profile

Remember: Focus on extracting factual information from the notes. If information is not available, indicate it as null or empty rather than making assumptions."""
