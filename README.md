# task_2
I have a people research agent and i don’t think so it produces all the information in one go. I was thinking of adding a reflection step. It should ideally take the notes, convert them to a structured format. The things I care most about are years of experience, current company, role, prior companies the person has worked at. After that, it should determine whether it is satisfactory, any thing is missing, anything else that should be searched, and reasoning for whether choosing to redo the process or not. I also want the agent to be deployable on langgraph so create langgraph.json as well and fixing any syntax/import issues.
